This 04-challenge- code quiz is an introduction to javascript. Students deploy a web page that is responsible for generating a mutliple choice quiz that is time based. For each wrong answer, the user loses 5 seconds of time. If the user runs out of time before completing the quiz they must start over. At the end of the quiz users input their initials/name to save a local highscore. This can be viewed from main screen and cleared from the main screen.
